    "It appears that our model is not very good at predicting the sentiment of a review. This is probably due to the fact that the dataset is imbalanced. We have a lot more positive reviews than negative reviews. We can try to balance the dataset by undersampling the positive reviews or oversampling the negative reviews. We can also try to use a different model such as a neural network. Addionally, we can try to use a different dataset that is more balanced and contains more information about the products. \n",
    "As, you can see our model achieved an accuracy of 0.67 and an F1 score of 0.80. This means that our model is 67% accurate and that it correctly predicted 80% of the positive reviews and 80% of the negative reviews."
